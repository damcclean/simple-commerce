## Native to Statamic

Simple Commerce feels native to Statamic. Your products, customers & orders are normal entries. There’s no intrusive front-end code, you can do everything you need to yourself using the provided Antlers Tags.

## First-party support for Stripe, Mollie & PayPal

Out of the box, Simple Commerce supports three of the big payment gateways: Stripe, Mollie & PayPal. If you need something else, it’s easy to build your own gateway.
